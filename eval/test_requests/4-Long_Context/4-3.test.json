    { "owner": "agent", "content": "Let me check. Flights to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, are currently priced lower, around $780. Vietnam is also a fantastic and affordable destination for backpacking." },

    { "owner": "agent", "content": "June is the monsoon season in southern Vietnam, so expect hot, humid weather with daily afternoon downpours. It's still a popular time to visit, though." },
    { "owner": "user", "content": "Good to know. Now find me some top-rated hostels in Ho Chi Minh City." },
    { "owner": "agent", "content": "Certainly. 'The Hideout Hostel' and 'Meander Saigon' are very popular with backpackers and have great reviews for their social atmosphere and value." }
