However, I can provide some general information:\n\n### Famous Historical Church\n- **San Miguel Mission**: Often considered the oldest church in the United States, San Miguel Mission in Santa Fe dates back to the early 17th century. It is known for its adobe architecture and rich history, making it a popular site for visitors.\n\n### Weather in Early November\nWhile I couldn't fetch the exact weather forecast, early November in Santa Fe typically features mild temperatures, ranging from the mid-40s to mid-60s Fahrenheit (about 7-18Â°C). It's advisable to bring a light jacket and possibly a rain cover for your photography gear, as there can be occasional rain.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date weather information, I recommend checking a reliable weather website closer to your travel date.",
