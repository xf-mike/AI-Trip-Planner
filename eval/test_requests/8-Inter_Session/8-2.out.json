However, typically, Tokyo experiences mild weather during this time, with average temperatures ranging from 10째C to 15째C (50째F to 59째F). \n\n**Packing Suggestions:**\n- Light layers (t-shirts, long sleeves)\n- A light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings\n- Comfortable shoes for walking\n- An umbrella or light raincoat, as March can have occasional rain\n\nFor the most accurate forecast closer to your travel date, consider checking a reliable weather website or app.",
