It houses a diverse collection of art and is an excellent indoor option to enjoy fine art while staying dry. You can also explore the architectural design of the building itself.\n\n**Dinner Suggestion:** For a high-end and unique dining experience, I recommend **Canlis**. It's a renowned Seattle institution known for its exquisite service, modern design (a winner of the James Beard Design Icon Award), and stunning views of Lake Union. This will definitely meet your 'luxury experience' preference.\n\nI highly recommend making a reservation for Canlis well in advance!",
