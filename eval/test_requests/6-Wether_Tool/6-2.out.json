However, I recommend checking reliable weather websites or apps closer to your travel date for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nFor photography, December can bring beautiful winter scenery, and you might encounter fog or snow, especially in higher elevations like the Grand Canyon's North Rim. Keep an eye on weather alerts for any potential storms that could enhance your photography opportunities.",
